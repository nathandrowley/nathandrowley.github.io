       <h2>Week 08 Notes</h2>
       <p>
       In this weeks readings I learned about the different way to manipulate text. <br>
       For example: 
       <br>
       <br>
        <h3>How to skew text</h3>
        Other examples included basic animation, rotation and, scaling. 
        <br> 
        In further readings I learned about creating a canvas. <br>
        "With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript. This can improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need to download images off the network. With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns. In addition, canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images and even video. We’ll start by introducing some of the basic drawing features of canvas, but then move on to using its power to transform our video—taking our modern-looking color video and converting it into conventional black and white to match the overall look and feel ofThe HTML5 Herald."<br>
