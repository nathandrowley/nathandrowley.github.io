    Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.</br>

    Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.</br>
    
    HTML5 has a large number of new input types that are beginning to be implemented in modern browsers.</br>
    
     document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.</br>
    
     form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.</br>
    
    Forms have focus , blur , and change events that fire as a user interacts with the form.</br>
    
    Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form before it’s been submitted.</br>
    
    The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value property of the form controls.</br>
    
    The HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form, but only at a basic level, so a custom validation script may be required.</br>
