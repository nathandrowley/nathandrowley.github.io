            Week 01 Notes 
•	Work from Mobile up. Not from desktop down. It is easier to scale up then retrofit down. 
•	Understand your user and what they want. 
•	Mobile devices aren’t going away, new devices will continue to come. 
•	Observe what your users are doing and find a way to fill their needs as simply as possible. 
•	Be there! Be ready to help users through their journey using your product or site. 
•	Be useful! If the users’ needs aren’t met when they come to your site they will leave and find an alternative.
•	Be quick! Less thinking is better. Make interactions easy or automatic. ( airline boarding pass example.) 
•	Reachability on mobile, making things easy to interact with on the screens. 
•	Focus on improving loading speeds. Reduce image usage outside of SVG/Webfonts format. Minify CSS and JS files as much as possible, remove unused items and make them as small as possible the smaller the file is to load the better and GZIP the files. 
•	Software sucks. Haha 
•	Placing the nav bar with the menu at the bottom may not look intuitive but is the more ergonomic placement you can have. 
•	Placement matters, when Facebook moved their nav bar to the bottom they saw a significant increase in use times. 
•	Understanding matters, using Icons that may be vague will hinder users. 
•	Make it simple. 
•	Forms have too much required information. 
•	Larger select boxes are always better. 
•	Only required information should be required. 
•	Enable auto complete on mobile forms. 
•	Typically, masking passwords doesn’t increase security. 
•	Having the best keyboard for the use will help users have an easier time. 
•	Making phone numbers tap-able to call will help streamline the process. Same with Email. 
•	End-users shape the market. By the way people use a tech. 
•	Rethink ads on mobile, pop-ups are bad. 
•	Scaling ad’s for screen sizes is the best thing to do. (how mobile reddit does ad’s) small and integrated into the site, not taking up 40% of the screen. Large ad’s make people leave sites. 
•	Video ad’s provide a higher conversion rate. 
•	Background ads can be a good way to display a full size add with out shadowing or blocking content. 
•	Content first. 
•	Empathize with the user.
