       The window object is the global object in a browser.<br>

       Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser environment.<br>
       
        alert , confirm() , and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that halt the execution of the program.<br>
       
       The window.navigator object gives information about the user’s browser and operating system, although it can be unreliable.<br>
       
       The window.location object provides information about the URL of the current page.<br>
       
       The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.<br>
       
       You can open, close, resize, and move windows (although, this doesn’t mean you should!).<br>
       
       The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.<br>
       
        document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.<br>
       
       Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property.<br>
       
       The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can be canceled using the clearTimeout() method.<br>
       
       The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the clearInterval() method.<br>
       
       The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.<br>

       HTML5.1 is the latest incarnation of the Hypertext Markup Language. It covers a variety of technologies, including several APIs that are accessible using JavaScript.<br>

        data- attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user experience with JavaScript.<br>

        The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user’s device in a similar way to cookies, but without the same storage restrictions.<br>

        The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user’s device, as long as the user gives permission.<br>

        The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps to avoid websites becoming unresponsive.<br>

        Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way communication.<br>

        The Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.<br>

        The audio and video elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They also have a Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.<br>

        The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in real-time using JavaScript.<br>

        A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.<br>
