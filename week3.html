    Objects are a collection of key-value pairs placed inside curly braces {}.</br>

Objects have properties that can be any JavaScript value. If it’s a function, it’s known as amethod.</br>

An object’s properties and methods can be accessed using either dot notation or square bracket notation.</br>

Objects are mutable, which means their properties and methods can be changed or removed.</br>

Objects can be used as parameters to functions, which allows arguments to be entered in any order, or omitted.</br>

Nested objects can be created by placing objects inside objects.</br>

JSON is a portable data format that uses JavaScript object literals to exchange information.</br>

The Math object gives access to a number of mathematical constants.</br>

The Math object can be used to perform mathematical calculations.</br>

The Date object can be used to create date objects.</br>

Once you’ve created a Date object, you can use the getter methods to access information about that date.</br>

Once you’ve created a Date object, setter methods can be used to change information about that date.</br>

The Regex object can be used to create regular expressions.</br>
The Document Object Model is a way of representing a page of HTML as a tree of nodes.</br>

The document.getElementById() , document.getElementsByClassName() , document.getElementsByTagNames() and document.querySelector() can be used to access elements on a page.</br>

The parentNode() , previousSibling() , nextSibling() , childNodes() and children() methods can be used to navigate around the DOM tree.</br>

An element’s attributes can be accessed using the getAttribute() method, and updated using the setAttribute() method.</br>

The createElement() and createTextNode() methods can be used to create dynamic markup on the fly.</br>

Markup can be added to the page using the appendChild() and insertBefore() methods.</br>

Elements can be replaced using the replaceChild() method, and removed using the removeChild() method.</br>

The innerHTML property can be used to insert raw HTML directly into the DOM.</br>

The CSS properties of an element can be changed by accessing the style property.</br>

Events occur when a user interacts with a web page.</br>

An event listener is attached to an element, then invokes a callback function when the event occurs.</br>

The event object is passed to the callback function as an argument, and contains lots of properties and methods relating to the event.</br>

There are many types of event, including mouse events, keyboard events, and touch events.</br>

You can remove an event using the removeEventListener method.</br>

The default behavior of elements can be prevented using the preventDefault() function.</br>

Event propagation is the order the events fire on each element.</br>

Event delegation is when an event listener is added to a parent element to capture events that happen to its children elements.</br>
