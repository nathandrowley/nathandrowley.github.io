        The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.<br>

        This kind of functionality was previously achieved using XMLHttpRequest. Fetch provides a better alternative that can be easily used by other technologies such as Service Workers. Fetch also provides a single logical place to define other HTTP-related concepts such as CORS and extensions to HTTP.<br>
    
        Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is called client-side form validation, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls. This article leads you through basic concepts and examples of client-side form validation.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Below is an Example of a form</h2>
        <form>
            <p>
              <fieldset>
                <legend>Do you have a driver's license?<abbr title="This field is mandatory" aria-label="required">*</abbr></legend>
                <!-- While only one radio button in a same-named group can be selected at a time,
                     and therefore only one radio button in a same-named group having the "required"
                     attribute suffices in making a selection a requirement --> 
                <input type="radio" required name="driver" id="r1" value="yes"><label for="r1">Yes</label>
                <input type="radio" required name="driver" id="r2" value="no"><label for="r2">No</label>
              </fieldset>
            </p>
            <p>
              <label for="n1">How old are you?</label>
              <!-- The pattern attribute can act as a fallback for browsers which
                   don't implement the number input type but support the pattern attribute.
                   Please note that browsers that support the pattern attribute will make it
                   fail silently when used with a number field.
                   Its usage here acts only as a fallback -->
