       <p>
        Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than later.<br>

        JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string "use strict" . This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.<br>
        
        Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions.<br>
        
        Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown.<br>
        
        The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code.<br>
        
        Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement.<br>
        
        An error object is created when an exception occurs.<br>
        
        Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. Any code inside a finally block will run if an exception does or does not occur.<br>
        
        Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.<br>
        
        The Jest framework can be used to test your code.<br>
